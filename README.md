# Preface
This page is transplanted from a former wiki page. As for today, there are still a considerable amount of visits to that (abandoned) wiki page, hopefully this Github page will serve those visitors well as an update-to-date mini tutorial on how to make images for publication using VMD. 

After 7 years, I would definitely say that I am still an active learner on rendering good images for biomolecules. Again, feel free to contact me through Github about your thoughts on this page. Any discussion will be greatly appreciated.

>I am also attending the journey of learning to render good images. So currently I could only provide you some useful links and my way of rendering. Please feel free to come to discuss with me or edit this page if you have a better way out. --Kevin 19:41, 14 May 2014 (HKT)
